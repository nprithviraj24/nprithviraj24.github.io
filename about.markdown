Hi, I'm Prithvi, a young post-graduate, with a year experience in building and deploying machine learning models as a service (MLaaS). Through this blog, I want to distill seemingly complicated deep learning and image processing techniques into simple language (without the jargon). Along with DL and Image processing techniques, I will also share some of my shell hacks that you might (hopefully) find useful. 

### Why this blog?

- I believe well-known techniques often make sense not just with simple and straight explanations, but sometimes with creative explanations. Creativity is a very subjective term, but its impact is often multifold.
- One has to grok creative explanations to understand them.
- You learn best when you practice, and truly understand something when you don't have to use technical jargon while explaining to yourself.
